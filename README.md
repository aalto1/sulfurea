Statistical learning algorithms: from approximation to random forest, written in R.

* Ex1 : this file allow you to approximate a target function defined in an Hilbert space [-1,1]. The basis of the space used is the Legendre. The Legendre polynomis is writte recursively not using any R packages. The linear and non-linear( greedy approximation) are both plotted to have an idea of how the story ends.
