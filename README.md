* linear_ and_greedy_approximation : this file allows you to approximate a target function(of ONE VARIABLE) defined in an Hilbert space [-1,1]. The basis of the space used is the Legendre. The Legendre polynomis is writte recursively not using any R packages. The linear and non-linear( greedy approximation) are both plotted to have an idea of how the story ends.
