Statistical learning algorithms: from approximation to random forest, written in R

#Repository contents

* linear_ and_greedy_approximation : this file allows you to approximate a target function(of ONE VARIABLE) defined in an Hilbert space [-1,1]. The basis of the space used is the Legendre. The Legendre polynomis is written recursively not using any R packages. The linear and non-linear( greedy approximation) are both plotted to have an idea of how the story ends.
* linear_approximation _tensor _basis : this file allows you to approximate a target function(of TWO VARIABLES) defined in an Hilbert space ([0,1]x[0,1]). The basis used is the Tensor cosine basis. The approximations are all plotted using the user-friendly persp3d.
